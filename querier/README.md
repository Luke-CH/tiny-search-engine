# CS50 TSE Querier
## Luke Crawford Hovis (Luke-CH)

The assignment and Specs are in a [public repo](https://github.com/cs50winter2022/labs/tse).
Do not clone that repo; view it on GitHub.
Watch there for any commits that may represent updates to the assignment or specs.

Add here any assumptions you made while writing the crawler, any ways in which your implementation differs from the three Specs, or any ways in which you know your implementation fails to work.

### Level Implemented
I implemented the highest level of this lab, handling operators appropriately and returning results in ranked order. 

### Assumptions
I make no assumptions beyond those that were enumerated in the specs

### Known Bugs
No Known bugs :)

### Previous Submission
I commited last night as I thought my implementation worked, but I realized today areas in which it was lacking. I decided to take the late penalty and submit a fully functional lab rather than let my previous one stand. My appologies if this caused any confusion/disruption.
